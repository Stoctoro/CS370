# CS370

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I had to implement a training algorithm for a path-finding agent using Q-Learning. I was given the code for the path simulation, the imports and environment initialization, as well as the neural network definition among other things. The code section that I needed to create was the loop that would train the agent.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

In essence, computer scientists try to solve problems using computers. As this field continues to grow more and more prevalent, more of the problems that arise become computer dependent. Meaning that computer scientists are required to maintain current solutions as well as develop new ones.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

The first thing we should do when presented with a problem is to analyze the problem itself. Before crafting a solution, it pays to know what exactly needs to be accomplished. Once descrete objectives becomes clear, we should research pre-existing solutions to find some that fit our needs. There's rarely a point in reinventing an answer that already exists; pick your battles. We then make a plan for what the overall shape of our solution is going to be using tools such as psuedocode or flowcharts. Next we implement any relevent code from our research and adapt it to fit our current scenario. After this, we merely fill in the areas that are still unimplemented using this same process at a smaller scale. Eventually, we reach a point where the code sections being worked on are intuitive enough to be done by hand.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As computer scientists, we have the responsibility to maintain the security of sensitive information for both our end users and employing organizations. It is equally important that we respect the systems of both end users and organizations, insuring that our programs do not act malaciously or introduce severe vulnerabilities. Of course, different fields of computer science have additional ethical concerns, but I would consider these to be applicable to most.
